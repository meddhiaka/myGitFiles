#### Wired connection, Wireless connection

* Wired connection: A set of devices linked to each others using cables

* Wireless connection: A set of devices linked to each others without using cables

<hr>

#### Network Components

* Any network must have : 

> * Computer systems (~ devices ...)
> * Network media (Fibre, Wireless, Copper Cables ...)
> * Network Interfaces ...(Carta eli f carte mere )
> * Network protocols (IP Protocol ...)

<hr>

#### Network Types
* Geographical Area

> * LAN: Local Area Network (ex: Hospital Network)
> * WAN: Wide Area Network (A bunch of connected LAN networks using WAN link in a big wide area ...) 

* Host Role

> * Peer-to-Peer: No priority in the term (Client/Server), Random administration everytime ...

> * Client/server:
> Client Server Host Role is scalable, expensive and admin centralized ...
> Specified roles initially, Client & the server will never change its roles ...
> * * Any device `request` a service is called `Client`
> * * Any device `provide` a service is called `Server` 

#### Advanced Network Types

* LAN: Local Area Network
* WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
* CAN: Campus Area Network (equivalent to LAN, Maybe a combination of two or three LANs)
* MAN: Metropolitan Area Network, Equivalent to CAN but the LANs are quite far...
* WAN: Wide Area Network
